In a post pandemic -- high inflation world, active travel
modes will become more important due to reduced public transport
capacities and increased costs.
New policies, investment programs (the
Active Travel Fund) and government agencies (Active Travel England) are
leading to increased demand for local evidence to better support
respective decision-making processes.

The OpenInfra project looks to assess the utility of
OpenStreetMap (OSM), an open and free editable map of the entire planet
built by volunteers, as local evidence to better support the decision
process for local policy provision, and to assist in the prioritisation
of upgrading or development of active travel infrastructure.
Through the
creation of transport infrastructure data packs, the project looks to
include value added data with a suite of openinfra package functions
that recategorise OSM data into a more insightful categories -- for more
