# OpenInfra: Utilising OpenStreetMap for sustainable transport planning

Investment in active travel modes offers multiple benefits while simultaneously tackling climate, health and cost-of-living crises.

New policies, investment programs and government agencies tasked with enabling active travel uptake demands high quality, geographically specific evidence to ensure that resources allocated to active travel are spent effectively.

The OpenInfra project explores the potential of open data sources to meet this demand.
Specifically, OpenStreetMap (OSM), an open and free editable map of the entire planet built by volunteers.
We hypothesise that OSM data can support decision-making processes, and the prioritisation of new active travel infrastructure.

Our findings broadly support this hypothesis, with some limitations, based on data driven comparison of OSM sources with official datasets such as Transport for London's Cycling Infrastructure Database (CID). Additionally, we present transport infrastructure data packs aimed at supporting transport planners working for every local authority in England.

The data-driven approach, implemented in the [open source openinfra package](https://github.com/udsleeds/openinfra) enables others to reproduce the findings and adapt our work for their own mobility and health research needs.
