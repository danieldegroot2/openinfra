OpenInfra project aims to explore the utility of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to support data-driven decision making for local infrastructure development. OSM is widely used in transport research, however, its potential for planning infrastructure development is yet to be fully explored (Nelson et al. 2021).

OpenInfra project aims to create transport infrastructre data packs for every transport authority in England. Yet, we also acknowledge the importance of skills in order to work with OSM data in a reproducible manner. Whilst there are many intuitive tutorials demonstrating how to add data to the OSM project, there is a lack of material demonstrating how to work with OSM data with a reporducible workflow. Therefore, making OSM data more accessible is another of the main objectives of the OpenInfra project.

As a result, several packages developed to acquire OSM data (osmextract for R, pyrosm and OSMnx for Python) were explored. Whilst these packages are effective in acquiring and analyzing OSM data, we have experienced some challenges, e.g. inconsistent levels of package documentation detail or bugs that could hinder adoption of OSM in transport planning. In this talk some of these issues will be demonstrated and potential solutions discussed, such as considering multi-programming language approach.
