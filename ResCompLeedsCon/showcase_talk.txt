Open Street Map (OSM) is widely used in transport research. However, its potential for planning infrastructure development is yet to be explored. OpenInfra hopes to explore the utility of OSM data as evidence to support decision making and local infrastructure development.

Whilst there are many intuitive tutorials demonstrating how to add data to the OSM project, there is a distinct lack of material relating to how to acquire and work with OSM data. Making OSM data more accessible is one of the main objectives behind the OpenInfra project, thus we have explored several ways of interacting with OSM data in a reproducible manner.

We have investigated several packages for acquiring and analysing geospatial OSM data, including osmextract (R), pyrosm & OSMnx (Python). Whilst these packages are effective in acquiring and analyzing OSM data, we have experienced some challenges - such as inconsistent levels of package documentation detail, and package bugs which can hinder analysis, especially as these packages typically have only one or two main contributors, working part-time.

OSM has the potential to encourage local participatory planning, an approach that is considered crucial for inclusive design. If we want infrastructure to be accessible to all we must ask those who wish to use it, OSM can help enable this!

It is of upmost importance to the OpenInfra project that our research and analysis be as reproducible as possible so that it is transparent and easy to learn from and should members of the public wish to re-create any analysis we have done (as a concerned citizen, or someone who wants to learn more!)
