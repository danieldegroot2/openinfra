The Open Infrastructure (OpenInfra) project aims to explore the utility of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data as evidence to support decision making and local infrastructure development. OSM is widely used in transport research, however, its potential for planning infrastructure development is yet to be fully explored.

The main deliverable from the OpenInfra project are transport infrastructre data packs for every transport authority in England, we also acknowledge the importance of skills to be able to work with OSM data in a reproducible manner. Whilst there are many intuitive tutorials demonstrating how to add data to the OSM project, there is a distinct lack of material relating to how to acquire and work with OSM data with a reporducible workflow. Making OSM data more accessible is another of the main objectives of the OpenInfra project.

We have investigated several packages for acquiring and analysing geospatial OSM data in a reproducible manner, including osmextract (R), pyrosm & OSMnx (Python). Whilst these packages are effective in acquiring and analyzing OSM data, we have experienced some challenges - such as inconsistent levels of package documentation detail, and package bugs which can hinder analysis. Indeed, such issues are likely the result of time-consuming labour required to develope and maintain such open source packages.

OSM has the potential to encourage local participatory planning, an approach that is considered crucial for inclusive design. If we want infrastructure to be accessible to all we must ask those who wish to use it, OSM can help enable this!
