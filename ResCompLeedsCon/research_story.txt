OpenInfra project is exploring the utility of OpenStreetMap (OSM) to support data-driven decision making for local infrastructure development. Openinfra use numerous open tools and computational packages within the python and R environments to obtain OSM data and perform analysis, including osmextract, pyrosm, and OSMnx. 

Whilst OSM has proved to be an extensive dataset on mapping the existence of infrastructure (roads, cycling paths, walking paths, e.t.c) one issue that has arisen is inconsistent infrastructure tagging schemes by separate OSM mappers, resulting in queries sometimes returning confusing infrastructure networks not reflective of the actual query. Additionally, several package bugs which can take time to fix with no dedicated full-time maintenance, sometimes an unavoidable issue when operating in an open environment.  

Whilst many intuitive tutorials exist demonstrating how to add data to OSM, there is a lack of material demonstrating how to work with OSM data with a reproducible workflow. Therefore, making OSM data more accessible is another of the main objectives of OpenInfra. We have also developed numerous functions in R that recategorizes OSM data, namely road classifications and infrastructure accessibility, based on whether features are compliant with the Inclusive Mobility (DfT) guide. Openinfra have also produced a draft transport infrastructure data pack for Leeds, containing recategorized OSM data from our functions.  

This talk discusses the Openinfra work and problems we have faced thus far and our attempts to remedy such issues. Additionally, we will discuss the future of the project, including the upscaled production of transport infrastructure data packs for every transport authority in England.
