Title:  

Open data and software: why use both? 

 

Abstract:  

Open software and data are key to ensure that transport modelling methods and results are transparent and reproducible to members of the public and to enable the democratisation of transport infrastructure design. This talk discusses a) the importance of open data, such as OpenStreetMap data, for transport infrastructure development including strengths and limitations, and b) how open software requires open data to reach their full potential.
